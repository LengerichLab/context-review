With the advancement of foundation models, the FLAN-MoE (fine-tuned language model with mixture of experts) architectures [@doi:10.48550/arXiv.2305.14705] represent a novel approach to these existing models, including efficiency involved with contextualised modeling. It combines instruction tuning and sparse mix of experts (MoE) which ensures combining larger domains of NLP tasks, reducing computational overhead, and ensuring efficient contextualisation concurrently. It ensures contextualisation by selecting specialised experts on the basis of the provided input by a dynamic gating mechanism. Instruction tuning further makes the capability even in broader aspects implementing few-shot and zero-shot generalization. It shows an improvement in result over the fully dense state-of-the-art models. Combining foundation modelsâ€™ transfer capabilities. Fine-grained control in task execution can be ensured along with contextual routing and expert activation of MoE architectures. It ensures handling of broad instructions with pre-trained knowledge and concurrently adapts to the sub-tasks of a specific task with expert selection.Moreover, FLAN-MoE can be interpreted as an application in post-hoc interpretability. Since different experts are assigned with particular tasks while providing particular output,. It gives insights for interpretability into the decision-making process of the model. To summarise, FLAN-MoE addresses the challenges of scaling, efficiency, and generalisation across a wider range of tasks by combining the idea of a sparse mixture of expert selection models and instruction tuning. The possible extension to it may involve more sophisticated gating mechanisms, multilingual instruction-tuning, and more to be explored.
